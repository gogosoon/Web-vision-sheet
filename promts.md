Build a desktop app using Electron with Vite and TailwindCSS. The app is called "Glintify", and its main function is to allow users to select an Excel file, enrich each row of the file with information from the web using AI (via web scraping + LLM prompts), and save all progress into a directory called "Glintify Workspace" inside the user's Documents folder.


Functional Requirements

    On launch, show a modern UI using TailwindCSS, with a clean interface for uploading an Excel file (.xlsx).

    The Excel file will contain rows of data. One column contains URLs or website names that need to be visited.

    For each row, open the corresponding website (via puppeteer), take screenshot, and use AI (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate enriched data for that row.

    The enriched data is then saved back to the Excel file in new columns.

    The app automatically creates and uses a folder called "Glintify Workspace" in the user's Documents directory to store:

        Original uploaded Excel file
        Auto-saved enriched version
        Logs (JSON) of enrichment operations

UI Screens:

HomeScreen:
    Purpose: Let the user upload an Excel file to begin the enrichment process.
    UI Elements:
        App Title: "Glintify AI Workspace" – center top
        Brief Description: "Enrich your Excel data with AI and website insights."
        File Upload Card:
            Dropzone-style UI (drag-and-drop or browse)
            Only accept .xlsx files
            On file selection, validate and preview basic file info (filename, rows, columns)
        
        Start Enrichment Button:
            Disabled until a valid file is selected
            Ask for which column contains the website
            Ask the user to add new columns with AI prompts (like table format with add new columns on top), (Column name, AI prompt)
            On click, Opens to Processing Screen model

Processing Screen Model:

    Show a progress bar with showing processing (Step 1: taking screenshots 1 / 30 rows, Step 2: Processing screenshots 1 / 30 rows)

    Log Panel (optional toggle):
        Expandable terminal-like window showing real-time logs per row (e.g. "Visiting https://example.com…", "AI response received.")

    Once completed the progress show the Results model

Results Screen Model:
    "Enrichment Complete!" + file name

    ✅ Download Final Excel

    📁 Open in Explorer/Finder

    🔁 Enrich Another File (reset app state)

The minute user uploads the file, create the directory in "Glintify Workspace",

Make sure to save all the data in data.json and then also put the uploaded excel file as input.xlsx

Implement the actaul screenshot functionality (make sure always save the data into workspace directory) and enriching process

When ever you open a puppter make sure to save it session with profile (use a directoy for config of our electon app)

Add a button on home page to Open Browser (open the puppeter with default profile created for our app)

Plus: I'm getting this error at the last step currently

"Module "path" has been externalized for browser compatibility. Cannot access "path.join" in client code. See https://vite.dev/guide/troubleshooting.html#module-externalized-for-browser-compatibility for more details."

First Understand the project, this project helps enrich the excel with AI by visting the each website -> taking screenshots -> promting LLM -> update the excel of each row with response from LLM

currently the exceljs written in renderer part (which is very wrong dude)
Always make sure exceljs part is completley isolated to backend process (ie.. Electron main process) not frontend (renderer part).

1. Move all exceljs part compleltey inside electron main process
2. On HomeScreen as you click Continue button, update the all state data to the json file in workspace
3. Move processExcelFile logic in ProcessingScreen to electon main process
-> it should read the input excel file
-> Open the puppetter and load the URL, wait untill network request completes
-> Take the full screenshot and save it like {workspace_dir}/screenshots/1.png (for 1st row)
-> Keep taking screenshots for all the websites in the excel rows
-> Once the screenshot rows is completed send the screenshot to LLM using fetch network request, along with promt column data user provided
-> get the response in JSON format and update the excel and keep saving the excel output.xlsx file with new columns (as you process each row keep updating the excel)

--
Okay now can you update the renderer part to fix the functionality of the changes you made?
